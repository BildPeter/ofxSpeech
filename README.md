This addon is a wrapper around the Apple [speech recognition](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Carbon/Reference/Speech_Recognition_Manager/Reference/reference.html) and [speech synthesis](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Carbon/Reference/Speech_Synthesis_Manager/Reference/reference.html) APIs. Ergo, it is Mac only.

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQZA8Im3UqA) to see the "zoo" example in action.  This will give you a realistic expectation of the accuracy of the library.

## Installation:
1. Place ofxSpeech in the addons folder.

## Adding to a Project:
1. Add the ofxSpeech to your project in the IDE (Xcode presumably).
2. Add #include "ofxSpeech.h" in your testApp.h


## ofxSpeechRecognizer (NOT WORKING FOR NOW):

1. **testApp.h** Add a function to your testApp that takes a string by reference, this function will get called when a word is recognized. Also declare a ofxSpeechRecognizer object.
	
        void speechRecognized(string & wordRecognized);
        
        ofxSpeechRecognizer recognizer;

1. **setup** In the testApp.cpp setup() function, add the function mentioned above as a listener to a speechRecognized event and init the recognizer.

        ofAddListener(recognizer.speechRecognizedEvent, this, &testApp::speechRecognized);

        recognizer.initRecognizer();

    You can load a list of words to recognize from a file in your data directory containing each word in a separate line.

        recognizer.loadDictionaryFromFile("dictionary.txt");

    Alternatively you can have a vector of words and add them that way

        vector<string> words;
        words.push_back("red");
        words.push_back("green");
        words.push_back("black");
        recognizer.loadDictionary(words);

    startListening for words

        recognizer.startListening();

1. **speechRecognized** In the function defined in testApp.cpp place code to be executed once a given word is detected

        void testApp::speechRecognized(string & wordRecognized)
        {
           if(wordRecognized == "red")
             ofBackground(255, 0, 0);

           if(wordRecognized == "green")
             ofBackground(0, 255, 0);
        }

    the recognized can be stopped

        recognizer.stopListening();


## ofxSpeechSynthesizer usage:

    //define and create an ofxSpeechSynthesizer object
    ofxSpeechSynthesizer synthesizer;

    //list available voices in the system
    synthesizer.listVoices();

    //initalize synthesizer with voice, if no voice is given the default system voice is used.
    synthesizer.initSynthesizer("Whisper");

    //speak a word or sentence
    synthesizer.speakPhrase("hello, this a test of the synthesizer");

    //to turn on spelling character by character
    synthesizer.setCharacterByCharacter(true);

    //to turn off spelling character by character
    synthesizer.setCharacterByCharacter(false);

    //to turn on digit by digit for numbers
    synthesizer.setDigitByDigit(true)

    //to turn off digit by digit for numbers
    synthesizer.setDigitByDigit(true)

    //to pause speaking
    synthesizer.pauseSpeaking();

    //to resume speaking
    synthesizer.continueSpeaking();

    //to stop speaking completely
    synthesizer.stopSpeaking();
